# MyReads Project

This is the project for React Nanodegree - Fundamentals course.

It features a dashboard used to organize books on different categories: currently reading, want to read and read. Users can delete or change each bookshelf. Also, users an add new books from a search view and add them to their lists.


## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
